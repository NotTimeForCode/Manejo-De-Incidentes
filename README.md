# Manejo-De-Incidentes

Moving files to be executed {
sudo mv * /var/www/html/

cd /var/www/html/

sudo chown www-data:www-data *

sudo chmod 755 *    // for permissions

ls -la
}

cat /var/log/apache2/error.log      // to see error logs

when a user tries to log into the same account incorrectly multiple times, the delay to try to log in again has to be longer.
The bruteforce protection has to control both ip and account name, because the ip of the user logging in can be changed, but the name can't.

To-Do List:
    comment code
    compatability to different sized screen
    incident in process text will not return to normal after deselecting it
